[Intro]
E  B7  E
 
[Verse 1]
E                                                    A
Well, my body could use a little slimmin', I keep my shirt on when I go swimmin'
         E                       B7         E
And I ain't seen my feet since 1984…the old lady wants a roll in the hay,
            A                              E                 B7       E
We turn the lights down all the way…'cause I don't look good naked anymore.
 
[Chorus]
    A                          E
No, I don't look good naked anymore…I'm a deep fried, double-wide version
                   B7           E                                              A
Of the man I was before.  If I keep on like I'm doin', I won't fit through the door,
    E                 B7       E
And I don't look good naked anymore.
 
[Verse 2]
E                                             A
Well, I used to be a hell of a man, I chopped wood with just one hand.
    E                              B7              E
But I can't do the things I done before.  Well, it all happened kind of slow,
      A                               E                 B7       E
But I guess I kinda let myself go…now I don't look good naked anymore.
 
[Chorus]
    A                          E
No, I don't look good naked anymore…I'm a deep fried, double-wide version
                   B7           E                                              A
Of the man I was before.  If I keep on like I'm doin', I won't fit through the door,
    E                 B7       E
And I don't look good naked anymore.
 
[Verse 3]
E                                        A
With each and every passing year, came a lot of french fries and beer.
       E                                 B7              E
And my belly hung a little closer to the floor.  Now, my belly is as big as a truck,
         A                                           E                 B7       E
And the old lady don't wanna SHE DON'T WANNA!  Cause I don't look good naked anymore.
 
[Chorus]
    A                          E
No, I don't look good naked anymore…I'm a deep fried, double-wide version
                   B7           E                                              A
Of the man I was before.  If I keep on like I'm doin', I won't fit through the door,
    E                 B7       E
And I don't look good naked anymore.
 
    A                          E
No, I don't look good naked anymore…I'm a deep fried, double-wide version
                   B7           E                                              A
Of the man I was before.  If I keep on like I'm doin', I won't fit through the door,
    E                 B7       E
And I don't look good naked anymore.
