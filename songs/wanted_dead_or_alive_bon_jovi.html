[Intro]
[Synth: 157]
A[1/4] F[1/4] D[1/4] E[1/4] 4 D[Long]
A[1/4] F[1/4] D[1/4] E[1/4] 7

[Verse 1]
[Synth: 41]
D                   C                  G
It's all the same, only the names will change
C     G      F                   D
Every day it seems we're wastin' away
D              C                      G
Another place where the faces are so cold
C             G          F            D
I'd drive all night just to get back home

[Chorus]
[Synth: 72]
C      G           F              D
I'm a cowboy, On a steel horse I ride
C        G F        D
I'm wanted dead or alive
C    G  F       D
Wanted dead or alive

[Verse 2]
[Synth: 41]
D                   C                     G
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
C             G           F                D
The people I meet always go their separate ways
D                           C                      G
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
C                     G             F              D
And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think

[Chorus 2]
[Synth: 72]
C      G           F              D
I'm a cowboy, On a steel horse I ride
C        G           F        D
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
C   G           F        D
Wanted (Wanted) dead or alive

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, and I ride
[Synth: 41]
[Guitar Solo, same chords as verse]

[Chorus 3]
[Synth: 72]
C               G       F              D
Ooh, I'm a cowboy, On a steel horse I ride
C                   F        D
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive

[Verse 3]
[Synth: 41]
D                          C                         G
But I walk these streets, a loaded six-string on my back
C             G         F                    D
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
D                                 C                 G
I've been everywhere, (Oh yeah) still I'm standin' tall
C                   G                F          D
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all

[Chorus]
[Synth: 41]
C              G           F              D
'Cause I'm a cowboy, On a steel horse, I ride
C        G           F        D
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
C            G               F           D
And I'm a cowboy, I got the night on my side
C            G           F       D
And I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive

[Outro]
C        G           F        D
And I ride (And I ride), dead or alive
C        G           F        D
I still drive (Still drive), dead or alive
C         D
Dead or alive
C         D
Dead or alive
C         D
Dead or alive
C         D
Dead or alive
