[Verse 1]

     D#                          G#               D#
On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
  G#               D#                G#                 A#
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
   D#                               G#             D#
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
     G#           D#        A#               D#
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.


[Verse 2]

	 D#                             G#                D#
He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
    G#                  D#                 G#                   A#
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
       D#                               G#                 D#
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
      G#             D#            A#             D#
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice."


[Verse 3]

     D#                           G#                  D#
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow. 
G#                D#             G#              A#
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
	D#                                G#                 D#
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
		 G#                    D#             A#                D#
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.


[Chorus]

	   D#                     G#             D#
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
G#            D#         G#                A#
know when to walk away and know when to run.
	  D#                            G#              D#
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
		 G#          D#        A#                 D#
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.


[Verse 4] 

E                             A             E
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
   A               E              A               B
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
       E                         A              E
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
	A                 E              B           E
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep."


[Verse 5]

    E                               A                       E
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
A               E             A            B
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
    E                             A                 E
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
    A            E                B                E
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.


[Chorus]

	   E                     A             E
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
A            E         A                B
know when to walk away and know when to run.
	  E                            A              E
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
		 A          E        B                 E
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.

[Only drums]
	   E                     A             E
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
A            E         A                B
know when to walk away and know when to run.
	  E                            A              E
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
		 A          E        B                 E
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.

	   E                     A             E
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
A            E         A                B
know when to walk away and know when to run.
	  E                            A              E
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
		 A          E        B                 E
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's <b>done</b>.
