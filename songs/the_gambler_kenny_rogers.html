            [Verse 1]
            On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere
            I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
            So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
            'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak

            [Verse 2]
            He said, "Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces
            And knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes
            So, if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
            For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice"

            [Verse 3]
            So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow
            Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
            And the night got deathly quiet and his face lost all expression
            Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy
            You gotta learn to play it right"

            [Chorus]
            You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
            Know when to walk away and know when to run
            You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
            There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

            [Verse 4]
            Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
            Is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep
            'Cause every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
            And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep
            [Verse 5]
            And when he finished speakin'
            He turned back towards the window
            Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep
            And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even
            But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep

            [Chorus]
            You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
            Know when to walk away and know when to run
            You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
            There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done

            [Outro]
            You got to know when to hold 'em (When to hold 'em)
            Know when to fold 'em (When to fold 'em)
            Know when to walk away and know when to run
            You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
            There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
            You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
            Know when to walk away and know when to run
            You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table
            There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealing's done
