	[Chorus]
	C            Dm    G7                       C
	  I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
		       Dm      G7                        C
	Along with the sunshine theres gotta be a little rain sometimes
		 F                                               Dm
	When you take you gotta give so live and let live or let go
		   Dm    G7                       C
	I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden

	[Verse]
		C
	I could promise you things like big diamond rings
						       Dm
	but you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover
				G7
	So you better think it over
		  C
	When it's sweet talking you could make it come true
							 Dm
	I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
			  G7
	But what would it matter

	[Bridge]
	   Dm                     G7
	So smile for a while and let's be jolly
	 Gm                  A7
	Love shouldn't be so melancholy
	Dm                                            Fm    G7
	Come along and share the good times while we can

	[Chorus]
		   Dm     G7                      C
	I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
		       Dm      G7                        C
	Along with the sunshine theres gotta be a little rain sometimes

		   Dm    G7                       C
	I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden

	[Verse]
		C
	I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon

	But if that's what it takes to hold you
			Dm
	Id just as soon let you go
				G7
	But there's one thing I want you to know
		    C
	You better look before you leap still waters run deep
						   Dm
	And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
			       G7
	And you know what I'm talking about

	[Bridge]
	    Dm                   G7
	So smile for a while and let's be jolly
	Gm                   A7
	Love shouldn't be so melancholy
	Dm                                            Fm    G7
	Come along and share the good times while we can

	[Chorus]
		   Dm     G7                      C
	I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
		       Dm      G7                        C
	Along with the sunshine theres gotta be a little rain sometimes
	C            Dm
	  I beg your pardon
