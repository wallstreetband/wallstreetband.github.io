[Chorus 1]
C            Dm    G7                       C
  I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
	       Dm      G7                        C
Along with the sunshine theres gotta be a little rain sometimes
	 F                                               Dm
When you take you gotta give so live and let live or let go
	   Dm    G7                       C
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden

[Verse 1]
	C
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
					       Dm
but you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover
			G7
So you better think it over
	  C
When it's sweet talking you could make it come true
						 Dm
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
		  G7
But what would it matter

[Bridge]
   Dm                     G7
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
 Gm                  A7
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Dm                                            Fm    G7
Come along and share the good times while we can

[Chorus 2]
	   Dm     G7                      C
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
	       Dm      G7                        C
Along with the sunshine theres gotta be a little rain sometimes

	   Dm    G7                       C
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden

[Verse 2]
	C
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon

But if that's what it takes to hold you
		Dm
Id just as soon let you go
			G7
But there's one thing I want you to know
	    C
You better look before you leap still waters run deep
					   Dm
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
		       G7
And you know what I'm talking about

[Bridge]
    Dm                   G7
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Gm                   A7
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Dm                                            Fm    G7
Come along and share the good times while we can

[Chorus 3]
	   Dm     G7                      C
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
	       Dm      G7                        C
Along with the sunshine theres gotta be a little rain sometimes
C            Dm
  I beg your pardon
