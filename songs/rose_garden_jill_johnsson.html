            [Chorus]
            I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
            Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
            When you take you gotta give so live and let live or let go
            I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden

            [Verse 1]
            I could promise you things like big diamond rings
            But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover
            So you better think it over
            Well, if sweet talkin' you could make it come true
            I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
            But what would it mattеr?

            [Pre-Chorus]
            So smile for a while and let's bе jolly
            Love shouldn't be so melancholy
            Come along and share the good times while we can

            [Chorus]
            I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
            Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometime
            I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden

            [Verse 2]
            I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
            But if that's what it takes to hold you, I'd just as soon let you go
            But there's one thing I want you to know
            You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
            And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
            And you know what I'm talkin' about
            [Pre-Chorus]
            So smile for a while and let's be jolly
            Love shouldn't be so melancholy
            Come along and share the good times while we can

            [Chorus]
            I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
            Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain sometime
            I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
            Along with the sunshine, there's gotta be a little rain sometime
