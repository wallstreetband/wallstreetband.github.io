Well, I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No I can't swig that sweet champagne
I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern, or in a honky tonk
Or on a four-wheel drive tailgate
I've got posters on my wall of Skynyrd, Kid, and Strait
Some people look down on me, but I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard with a baby on my hip

Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high-class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say, 'hey y'all' and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So, here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah', from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
Hell yeah

Victoria's Secret, well their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing on a Wal-Mart shelf half price
And still look sexy, just as sexy as those models on TV
No, I don't need no designer tag to make my man want me
Well, you might think I'm trashy, a little too hardcore
But in my neck of the woods I'm just the girl next door
Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say, 'hey y'all' and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah' from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
Hell yeah

I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say, 'hey y'all' and 'yee-haw'
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every ol' Bocephus song
So here's to all my sisters out there keeping it country
Let me get a big 'hell yeah' from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
I said hell yeah
