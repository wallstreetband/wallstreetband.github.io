[Verse 1]
		   G
I'm through with standing in line, to clubs I'll never get in
	       C
It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
      F                                              G
This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want to be.

	    G
I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
	C
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
	F                                    G
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me

	       G
I need a, a credit card that's got no limit
	C
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
       F                                                G
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet

	  G
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
	 C
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
      F                                            G
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me

[Pre-Chorus]
	   Bb
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
	  C
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

[Chorus]
	  G
Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
	    Bb
And live in hilltop houses driving 15 cars
     C
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
      Eb                        F
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat and we'll
G                                     Bb
Hang out in the coolest bars, in the VIP with the movie stars
       C
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
	 Eb                    F
Every playboy bunny with her bleached blonde hair and we'll

Bb   C                      G
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar
Bb   C                      G
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar

[Verse 2]
	    G
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
       C
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
	 F                                          G
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free

	    G
I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
	C
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
	F                                               G
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me

[Pre-Chorus]
	   Bb
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
	  C
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

[Chorus]
	 G
Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
	    Bb
And live in hilltop houses driving 15 cars
     C
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
      Eb                       F
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat and we'll
G                                     Bb
Hang out in the coolest bars, in the VIP with the movie stars
	     C
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
	  Eb                    F
Every playboy bunny with her bleached blonde hair and we'll

	 G
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
	   Bb
With the latest dictionary of today's who's who
	 C
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
      Eb                      F
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial

Bb   C                      G
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar
Bb   C                      G
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar

[Bridge]
	  Eb
I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
      Bb
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
    Eb
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs 
     C                               F
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

[Chorus]
	 G
Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
	    Bb
And live in hilltop houses driving 15 cars
    C
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
      Eb                       F
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat and we'll
G                                     Bb
Hang out in the coolest bars, in the VIP with the movie stars
	C
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
	 Eb                     F
Every playboy bunny with her bleached blonde hair and we'll

Bb   C                      G
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar
Bb   C                      G
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar
