[Intro]
Fm C# G#  x2
 
[Verse 1]
Fm     C#          G#
Headed out to California
Fm      C#              G#
Gone west to see the sun
Fm              C#             G#
There's a fortune here if you got time, but I've found mine
Fm             C#             G#
Buried in the golden hair she spun
Fm      C#              G#
Sailin' off to search the islands
Fm   C#                  G#
Gone west for somethin' new
Fm        C#             G#
Found paniolo and wave riders, but chose neither
Fm                     C#            G#
Picked the sweetest sugar cane they grew
 
 
[Chorus]
                Fm        C#                G#            D#
I've gone west, rollin' down the highway like a tumbleweed
              Fm          C#               G#               D#
I've gone west, where the canyons fall into the deep blue sea
           Fm        C#                G#      D#
Took a left from the hills of Tennessee, yeah
              Fm            C#              G#
I've gone west to bring the best back with me
              Fm            C#              G#
I've gone west to bring the best back with me
 
 
[Verse 2]
Fm            C#          G#   G#/G
I chased the light to Amarillo
Fm        C#            G#    G#/G
Where the wild horses run
Fm       C#             G#
Caught a painted-angel moonrise, kinda spitfire
Fm            C#            G#
Like a bullet from a smokin' gun
Fm    C#              G#        G#/G
Goin' back to mama's homeland
Fm        C#               G#     G#/G
Playin' in the field of dreams
Fm    C#                   G#
I was lookin' where the corn grows and the skies glow
Fm               C#         G#
And I found your beauty in between
 
 
[Chorus]
               Fm         C#                G#            D#
I've gone west, rollin' down the highway like a tumbleweed
               Fm         C#               G#               D#
I've gone west, where the canyons fall into the deep blue sea
           Fm        C#                G#       D#
Took a left from the hills of Tennessee, yeah
              Fm            C#              G#
I've gone west to bring the best back with me
              Fm            C#              G#
I've gone west to bring the best back with me
 
 
[Bridge]
      C#                       G#
And I follow the fadin' light
         C#                       G#
'Til the stars are my map at night
       A#m                      Fm
And if you come to get me and my house is empty
     C#       D#
It's safe to guess I've gone west
 
Fm C# G#  x2
 
 
[Chorus]
[Only drums]
               Fm       C#                G#            D#
I've gone west, rollin' down the highway like a tumbleweed
[Only drums]
               Fm         C#               G#               D#
I've gone west, where the canyons fall into the deep blue sea
           Fm        C#                G#      D#
Took a left from the hills of Tennessee, yeah
              Fm            C#              G#
I've gone west to bring the best back with me
              Fm            C#              G#
I've gone west to bring the best back with me
