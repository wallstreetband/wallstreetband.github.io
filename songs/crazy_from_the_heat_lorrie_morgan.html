 Bbm
Summertime came to Sycamore Street
 Ab                      Bbm
They were seventeen and crazy from the heat
 Bbm 
Full moon filled the Mississippi sky
 Ab        Bbm   
That was their first time

 Bbm
Silhouettes danced on the living room wall
     Ab                                        Bbm
She took him by the hand and led him down the hall
 Bbm 
Under the spell of a Casablanca fan
Ab                     Bbm
She became a woman and he became a man

Db  Ab
Oh, the fire and lust
                 Bbm
Draws you in and burns you up
Db   Ab
Ooh, the feeling's so sweet
		     Bbm
Makes you go crazy, crazy from the heat

All summer along they were slipping around
Making the most of that feeling they'd found
Word got out, the town began to talk
Her mama and daddy found out about it all

Oh, the fire and lust
Draws you in and burns you up
Ooh, the feeling's so sweet
Makes you go crazy, crazy from the heat

Cardboard boxes on a cold drive way
He watched from his window as they drove away
She looked up, she got in
He never saw her again

Oh, the fire and lust
Draws you in and burns you up
Ooh, the feeling's so sweet
Makes you go crazy, crazy from the heat

Summertime came to Sycamore Street
They were seventeen and crazy from the heat
