            Summertime came to Sycamore Street
            They were seventeen and crazy from the heat
            Full moon filled the Mississippi sky
            That was their first time

            Silhouettes danced on the living room wall
            She took him by the hand and led him down the hall
            Under the spell of a Casablanca fan
            She became a woman and he became a man

            Oh, the fire and lust
            Draws you in and burns you up
            Ooh, the feeling's so sweet
            Makes you go crazy, crazy from the heat

            All summer along they were slipping around
            Making the most of that feeling they'd found
            Word got out, the town began to talk
            Her mama and daddy found out about it all

            Oh, the fire and lust
            Draws you in and burns you up
            Ooh, the feeling's so sweet
            Makes you go crazy, crazy from the heat

            Cardboard boxes on a cold drive way
            He watched from his window as they drove away
            She looked up, she got in
            He never saw her again

            Oh, the fire and lust
            Draws you in and burns you up
            Ooh, the feeling's so sweet
            Makes you go crazy, crazy from the heat

            Summertime came to Sycamore Street
            They were seventeen and crazy from the heat
