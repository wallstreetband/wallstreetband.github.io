            East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
            A-we gonna do what they say can't be done
            We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there
            I'm east bound, just watch ol' "Bandit" run

            Keep your foot hard on the pedal
            Son, never mind them brakes
            Let it all hang out 'cause we got a run to make
            The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
            And there's beer in Texarkana
            And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes

            East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
            A-we gonna do what they say can't be done
            We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there
            I'm east bound, just watch ol' "Bandit" run

            East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
            A-we gonna do what they say can't be done
            We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there
            I'm east bound, just watch ol' "Bandit" run

            Ol' Smokey's got them ears on
            He's hot on your trail
            And he aint gonna rest 'til you're in jail
            So you got to dodge 'im and you got to duck 'im
            You got to keep that diesel truckin'
            Just put that hammer down and give it hell

            East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
            A-we gonna do what they say can't be done
            We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there
            I'm east bound, just watch ol' "Bandit" run
