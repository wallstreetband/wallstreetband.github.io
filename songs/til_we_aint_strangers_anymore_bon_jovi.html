            It might be hard to be lovers
            But its harder to be friends
            Baby pull down the covers
            Its time you let me in

            Maybe light a couple candles
            Ill just go ahead and lock the door
            If you just talk to me baby
            Til we ain't strangers anymore
                        
            Lay your head on my pillow
            I sit beside you on the bed
            Don't you think its time we say
            Some things we haven't said

            It ain't too late to get back to that place
            Back to where, we thought it was before
            Why don't you look at me
            Til we ain't strangers anymore

            Sometimes its hard to love me
            Sometimes its hard to love you too
            I know its hard believing
            That love can pull us through
            It would be so easy
            To live your life
            With one foot out the door
            Just hold me baby
            Til we ain't strangers anymore

            Its hard to find forgiveness
            When we just run out of lies
            Its hard to say you're sorry
            When you cant tell wrong from right

            It would be so easy
            To spend your whole damn life
            Just keeping score
            So lets get down to it baby
            There ain't no need to lie

            Tell me who you think you see
            When you look into my eyes
            Lets put our two hearts back together
            And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor
            Make love with me baby
            Til we ain't strangers anymore

            We're not strangers anymore
            We're not strangers
            We're not strangers anymore
