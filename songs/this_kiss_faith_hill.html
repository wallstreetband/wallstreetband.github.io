            [Verse 1]
            I don't want another heartbreak
            I don't need another turn to cry, no
            I don't wanna learn the hard way
            Baby, hello
            Oh no, goodbye
            But you got me like a rocket
            Shooting straight across the sky

            [Chorus]
            It's the way you love me
            It's a feeling like this
            It's centrifugal motion
            It's perpetual bliss
            It's that pivotal moment
            It's, ah, impossible
            This kiss, this kiss
            Unstoppable
            This kiss, this kiss

            [Verse 2]
            Cinderella said to Snow White
            "How does love get so off course, oh
            All I wanted was a white knight
            With a good heart
            Soft touch, fast horse"
            Ride me off into the sunset
            Baby, I'm forever yours
            [Chorus]
            It's the way you love me
            It's a feeling like this
            It's centrifugal motion
            It's perpetual bliss
            It's that pivotal moment
            It's, ah, unthinkable
            This kiss, this kiss
            Unsinkable
            This kiss, this kiss

            [Bridge]
            You can kiss me in the moonlight
            On the rooftop under the sky, oh
            You can kiss me with the windows open
            While the rain comes pouring inside, oh
            Kiss me in sweet slow motion
            Let's let everything slide
            You got me floating
            You got me flying

            [Chorus]
            It's the way you love me (The way)
            It's a feeling like this
            It's centrifugal motion (Ahh, ahh)
            It's perpetual bliss
            It's that pivotal moment
            It's, ah, subliminal
            This kiss, this kiss
            It's criminal
            This kiss, this kiss
            It's the way you love me, baby (The way you love me, baby)
            It's the way you love me, darling, yeah
            [Chorus]
            It's the way you love me (The way)
            It's a feeling like this
            It's centrifugal motion (Ahh, ahh)
            It's perpetual bliss
            It's that pivotal moment
            It's, ah, subliminal
            This kiss, this kiss
            It's criminal
            This kiss, this kiss
            It's the way you love me, baby (The way you love me, baby)
            It's the way you love me darling, yeah

            [Outro]
            It's the way you love me
            It's a feeling like this
            It's centrifugal motion
