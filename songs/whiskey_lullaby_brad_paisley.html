[Verse 1]
	     D            G                         Bm
She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
       A        D        G                              A
She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
    Bm                         A       D
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
       Bm                      A        D
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
	  A
Until the night


[Chorus 1]
	     D                                  A
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
     Bm                        G
And finally drank away her memory
 D                                  A
Life is short but this time it was bigger
	    Bm                             G
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
      D                                  A
We found him with his face down in the pillow
  Bm                                        G
With a note that said I'll love her till I die
      D                              A
And when we buried him beneath the willow
       G                      Bm
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby

  Bm                         G
la la la la la la la lalalalala
 Bm                          G
la la la la la la la lalalalala


[Verse 2]
      D                G                               Bm
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
     A          D         G                                A
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
     Bm                      A      D
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
	Bm                      A        D
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
	   A
Until the night


[Chorus 2]
	      D                                 A
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
     Bm                        G
And finally drank away his memory
 D                                  A
Life is short but this time it was bigger
	  Bm                                 G
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
    D                                   A
We found her with her face down in the pillow
 Bm                               G
clinging to his picture for dear life
    D                                A
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
	   G                         Bm
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby


[Interlude]
 Bm                         G
la la la la la la la lalalalala   (gradually grow softer)
 Bm                         G
la la la la la la la lalalalala
 Bm                         G
la la la la la la la lalalalala
 Bm                             
la la la la la la la lalalalala
