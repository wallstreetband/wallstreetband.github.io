            [Verse 1: Brad Paisley]
            She put him out
            Like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
            She broke his heart
            He spent his whole life tryin' to forget
            We watched him drink his pain away
            A little at a time
            But he never could get drunk enough
            To get her off his mind
            Until the night

            [Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss ]
            He put that bottle to his head
            And pulled the trigger
            And finally drank away her memory
            Life is short, but this time it was bigger
            Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
            We found him with his face down in the pillow
            With a note that said, "I'll love her 'til I die"
            And when we buried him beneath the willow
            The Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

            [Break: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
            La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
            La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
            [Verse 2: Alison Krauss]
            The rumors flew
            But nobody knew how much she blamed herself
            For years and years
            She tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
            She finally drank her pain away
            A little at a time
            But she never could get drunk enough
            To get him off her mind
            Until the night...

            [Chorus: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
            She put that bottle to her head
            And pulled the trigger
            And finally drank away his memory
            Life is short, but this time it was bigger
            Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
            We found her with her face down in the pillow
            Clinging to his picture for dear life
            We laid her next to him beneath the willow
            While the Angels sang a whiskey lullaby

            [Outro: Brad Paisley & Alison Krauss]
            La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
            La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
            La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
            La la la la la la la, la la la la la la laa
