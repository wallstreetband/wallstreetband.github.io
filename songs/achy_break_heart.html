[Riff]
A  E  A
 
 
[Verse 1]
A
You can tell the world
 
You never was my girl
                                  E
You can burn my clothes when I am gone
 
Or you can tell your friends
 
Just what a fool I've been
                                   A
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
 
 
[Verse 2]
A
You can tell my arms
 
Go back into the farm
                                E
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
 
Or you can tell my lips
 
To tell my fingertips
                                      A
They won't be reaching out for you no more
 
 
[Chorus]
    A
But don't tell my heart
 
My achy breaky heart
                             E
I just don't think it'd understand
 
And if you tell my heart
 
My achy breaky heart
                               A
He might blow up and kill this man
  A    E  A
Uuuuuuu..
 
 
[Verse 3]
A
You can tell your maw
 
I moved to Arkansas
                                  E
You can tell your dog that bit my leg
 
Or tell your brother Cliff
 
Whose fist can tell my lip
                            A
He never really liked me anyway
 
 
[Verse 4]
   A
Go tell your aunt Louise
 
Tell anything you please
                              E
Myself already knows I'm not okay
 
Or you can tell my eye
 
Watch out for my mind
                                  A
It might be walkin' out on me one day
 
 
[Chorus]
    A
But don't tell my heart
 
My achy breaky heart
                             E
I just don't think it'd understand
 
And if you tell my heart
 
My achy breaky heart
                               A
He might blow up and kill this man
  A    E
Uuuuuuu..
 
 
[Chorus]
    A
But don't tell my heart
 
My achy breaky heart
                             E
I just don't think it'd understand
 
And if you tell my heart
 
My achy breaky heart
                               A
He might blow up and kill this man
 
Uuuuuuu..
 
N.C.
But don't tell my heart
 
My achy breaky heart
 
I just don't think it'd understand
 
And if you tell my heart
 
My achy breaky heart
 
He might blow up and kill this man
   A    E  A  E  A
