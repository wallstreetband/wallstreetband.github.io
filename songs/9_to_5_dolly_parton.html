            Well, I tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
            Pour myself a cup of ambition
            Yawn and stretch and try to come to life

            Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
            Out on the street, the traffic starts jumping
            With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

            Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
            Barely getting by, it's all taking and no giving
            They just use your mind, and they never give you credit
            It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it

            Working 5 to 9, you've got passion and a vision
            'Cause it's hustlin' time, a whole new way to make a livin'
            Gonna change your life, do somethin' that gives it meanin'
            With a website that is worthy of your dreamin'

            Well you got dreams and you know they matter
            Be your own boss, climb your own ladder
            That moment's getting closer by the day

            And you're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
            Launching ideas you all believe in
            The tide's gonna turn, and it's all gonna roll your way

            Working 5 to 9, making something of your own now
            And it feels so fine to build a business from your know-how
            Gonna move ahead, and there's nothing that you can't do
            When you listen to that little voice inside you

            Yeah, 5 to 9 you've got passion and a vision
            'Cause it's hustlin' time, a whole new way to make a livin'
            Gonna change your life, do somethin' that gives it meanin'
            With a website that is worthy of your dreaming

            5 to 9, you keep working, working, working
            Working 5 to 9, 'til your dreams, come true
            Working 5 to 9, you keep dreaming, dreaming, dreaming
            5 to 9, 5 to 9, you can do it
