[Intro]
A E7 D A

[Verse 1]
A
When I was a little bitty baby
	   D               A
My mama would rock me in the cradle
			    E7
In them old cotton fields back home

A
It was down in Louisiana
	  D              A
Just about a mile from Texarkana
	 E7    E           A D A
In them old cotton fields back home

[Chorus 1]
	   D
Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten
       A
You can't pick very much cotton
			    E7
In them old cotton fields back home

    A
It was down in Louisiana
	  D              A
Just about a mile from Texarkana
	 E7     E          A D A
In them old cotton fields back home

[Verse 2]
