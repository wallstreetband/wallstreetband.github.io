            When I was a little bitty baby
            My mama would rock me in the cradle
            In them old cotton fields back home

            It was down in Louisiana
            Just about a mile from Texarkana
            In them old cotton fields back home
                       
            Oh, when them cotton bolls get rotten
            You can't pick very much cotton
            In them old cotton fields back home
