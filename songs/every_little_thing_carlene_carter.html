		[Intro]
		A

		[Verse]
		A
		I hear songs on the radio
		     E
		They might be fast or they might be slow
								 A
		But every song they play's got me thinkin' 'bout you
		  A
		I see a fella walkin' down the street
		   E
		He looks at me and he smiles real sweet
		    E                                               A
		But he don't matter to me 'cause I'm thinkin' 'bout you

		[Chorus]
			     D
		Every little dream I dream about you
			     A
		Every little thought I think about you
		E
		Drives me crazy when you go away
					       A
		I oughta keep you locked up at home
			   D
		And like a wild horse I wanna break you
		  A
		I love you so much I hate you
			     E
		Every little thing reminds me of you
						 A
		Honey when you leave me here all alone

		[Verse]
		A
		My tongue gets tied when I try to talk
		   E
		My knees get weak when I start to walk
								     A
		So I might as well stay home and keep thinkin' 'bout you
		    A
		The Young and Restless on my TV set
		       E
		That's just like us when we first met
		    E                                               A
		And when they start to kissin' got me thinking bout you

		[Chorus]
			     D
		Every little dream I dream about you
			     A
		Every little thought I think about you
		E
		Drives me crazy when you go away
					       A
		I oughta keep you locked up at home
			   D
		And like a wild horse I wanna break you
		  A
		I love you so much I hate you
			     E
		Every little thing reminds me of you
						 A
		Honey when you leave me here all alone         C'mon!

		[Instrumental]
		B    F#       B
				    (Oh!)
		B    F#    A  E  B

		[Chorus]
			     E
		Every little dream I dream about you
			     B
		Every little thought I think about you
		F#
		Drives me crazy when you go away
					       B
		I oughta keep you locked up at home
			   E
		And like a wild horse I wanna break you
		  B
		I love you so much I hate you
			     F#
		Every little thing reminds me of you
						 B
		Honey when you leave me here all alone

		[Outro]
			     F#
		Every little thing reminds me of you
						 B
		Honey when you leave me here all alone
			     F#
		Every little thing reminds me of you
						 A
		Honey when you leave me here all alone
		E             B
		     Oh, woh, woh
