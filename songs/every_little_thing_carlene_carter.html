            I hear songs on the radio
            They might be fast or they might be slow
            But every song they play's got me thinkin' 'bout you
            I see a fella walkin' down the street
            He looks at me and he smiles real sweet
            But he don't matter to me
            'Cause I'm thinkin' 'bout you

            Every little dream I dream about you
            Every little thought I think about you
            Drives me crazy when you go away
            I oughta keep you locked up at home
            And like a wild horse I want to break you
            I love you so much I hate you
            Every little thing reminds me of you
            Honey when you leave me here all alone

            My tongue gets tied when I try to talk
            My knees get weak when I start to walk
            So I might as well stay home and keep thinkin' 'bout you
            "the young and the restless" on my tv set
            That's just like us when we first met
            And when they start to kissin'
            Got me thinking bout you

            Every little dream I dream about you
            Every little thought I think about you
            Drives me crazy when you go away
            I oughta keep you locked up at home
            And like a wild horse I want to break you
            I love you so much I hate you
            Every little thing reminds me of you
            Honey when you leave me here all alone

            Every little dream I dream about you
            Every little thought I think about you
            Drives me crazy when you go away
            I oughta keep you locked up at home
            And like a wild horse I want to break you
            I love you so much I hate you
            Every little thing reminds me of you
            Honey when you leave me here all alone
